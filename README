COP290 Project1, Sub Task 1:
Author: Sarthak(2020CS10379)
The tar file contains:
-->README file
-->2020CS10379.cpp (Source Code File)
-->Makefile
All the functions are present in 2020CS10379.cpp


The functions defined are:
fullyconnected: Takes in names of input,weight,bias and output matrices as input and prints the fullyconnected layer to outputname.txt
relu: Takes in names of input and output matrices and prints the relu function of individual elements of input matrix on the output matrix
tanh: Takes in names of input and output matrices and prints the tanh function of individual elements of input matrix on the output matrix
maxpooling: Takes in names of input, stride length and output name and prints the max pooled matrix in column major form on outputname.txt
averagepooling: Takes in names of input, stride length and output name and prints the max pooled matrix in column major form on outputname.txt
softmax: Applies the softmax function on a given vector taken as input name and prints it to outputname.txt
sigmoid: Applies the sigmoid function on a given vector taken as input name and prints it to outputname.txt


Any error in commands on terminal will create an error.txt which contains the type of error occured.
Any error in the txt files will create the txt file with outputname.txt but printing the eroor occured.


To compile and run, type "make" in the terminal
This will create a "yourcode.out" file which will be executed with the respective terminal command for the specific functions


For example: Suppose we wish to run the relu function on inputmatrix.txt to create an outputmatrix.txt
For this, we first type "make" in the terminal to create the "yourcode.out" file
Now we need to type ./yourcode.out activation relu inputmatrix.txt outputmatrix.txt to create outputmatrix.txt after ensuring that we have an inputmatrix.txt
